I am a data scientist specializing in R programming. `dndR` began as a risk-free way to improve my coding skills but evolved into a package to help share my love for Dungeons and Dragons. I still use `dndR` to self-teach new tools but now I hope that others find this R package useful as well! I have been playing D&D since 2018 and have been a Dungeon Master running my own campaigns since 2021.
