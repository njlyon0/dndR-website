# `dndR`: An R Package for Dungeons & Dragons

The goal of `dndR` is to provide a suite of Dungeons & Dragons (Fifth Edition a.k.a. "5e") related functions to help both players and Dungeon Masters (DMs).

## `dndR` Website

This repository creates the standalone website for the `dndR` package. This does mean I need to maintain the package and the website separately but this is preferable to trying to balance the competing needs of these two repository purposes.

The website is styled after a vignette (though more verbose) so hopefully it provides a good introduction into the `dndR` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dndR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njlyon0/dndR")
```
